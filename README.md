Hello everyone my name is Oscar Quintanilla and this is a website developed for **practice purpose** to improve my career as a software developer. Currently, I'm a Java Developer however I'm learning JavaScript Technologies and this is my first version of the website. 

The website developed by just me using the following technologies:

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript
- Spring boot
- PosgreSQL

The website was developed for helping me to show all the projects that I'm working on it because the main function is a personal portfolio, and the second version will work as a personal blog.

:sunglasses: watch the demo here:  https://owqh.github.io/

Feel free to check the code and website, if you like please give to me your feedback. I'll more than happy to hear about it.
